\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame containing columns for the censoring indicator and the all covariates involved in the weights}

\item{cens_ind}{a character string indicating the name of censoring indicator from \code{data}, defined to be \code{=1} if observation is uncensored and \code{=0} if observation is censored}

\item{weights_cov}{a list of character strings indicating the names of the variables from \code{data} to be used as predictors in the weights model}

\item{cens_name}{a character string indicating the name of censored covariate from \code{data}}
}
\value{

}
\description{
